            Apparently, Shinnosuke Nohara is the young boy on whom the character of a 5 year old Shin Chan is based. Nohara died in a car accident while trying to save his younger sister. After his death, the mother Misae experienced a period of deep misery and she started sketching her lost son. A young Nohara and his mischiefs returned as flashes of memory as a mourning mother crayoned her dead child into sketches. Later, when Usai gazed at those beautiful paintings, he was struck by the intensity of the despair and hope these sketches simultaneously reflected.</h5></p>
